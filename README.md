# Final Report Formatting Requirements
The final report should be at least 6 pages long (not counting any appendices, and more if you use lots of
diagrams, code, etc.), using the two-column, IEEE conference proceedings format. Reports should
generally use the following organization, though exceptions can be made if your project does not fit well
into the usual framework:
• Abstract (2 paragraphs, max)
• Introduction
• Background, including related work, past approaches, etc.
• Solution / technology description – how it works, why it works, etc.
• Case study, results, analysis
• Summary and conclusion
• References
• Appendix (if necessary), to provide things such as complete model code, etc.
